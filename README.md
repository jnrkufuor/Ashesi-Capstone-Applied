A course scheduling application that is built on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript and PHP. It implements a genetic algorithm to find an optimal course schedule.

#### Course Scheduling
Course Scheduling has been found to be a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard(NP-hard) problem and hence has no fixed or definite solution(However there may be many). The usual constraints are on space/rooms, timeslots and human resource available.A general overview of the constraints may be:

*	A lecturer not being assigned to more than one) lecture hall at the same time.
*	A student not having more than one course at the same time.
*	A lecture hall not hosting more than one course at the same time.
*	More recently, a lecturer not having three or four courses assigned to him or her running concurrently.

#### Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithms have been proved to be more efficient solutions to the classical course scheduling issue as opposed to using brute force. It has no definite solution and can have several solutions. Heuristic algorithms like genetic algorithms and tabu search have been used to tackle the solution though each algorithm comes with its own benefits like computation speed or number of allowable variables.

It would be nice to go over what and how a genetic algorithm works but there are much better ariticles and videos out there that explain this. I will link a few below:

There are tons of papers oit there that can help you understand the fundamental concepts.
